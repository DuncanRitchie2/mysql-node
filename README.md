# mysql-node
🗄️ My first project connecting MySql to a frontend.

🗄️ Very basic, and not deployed, but it got me started in my foray into the tech stack.

🗒️ A more substantial project is the [reminders app](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/reminders) I did with my classmates Stefan Gouldson and Tom Ormiston.
